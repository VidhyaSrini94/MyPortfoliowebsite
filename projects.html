    <h2><span>Project Overview:</span> </h2>
    <h3><span>Responsive Navigation bar using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</span></h3>
    
Objective: 
<p>The main objective of the project is to design a Navigation bar which is one of the most important elements in the
website. As a web developer, it is important to design a page that is responsive to all sizes of devices. 
In this case when the user is in mobile view, most of the links are hidden and the menus are accessible by 
clicking the menu button.</p>

   <h3><span>Python Quiz Application</span></h3>
Objective: 
<p>The main objective of the project is to create a basic application that can ask multiple choice questions, match 
the user input with the correct answer and make it more user friendly.  In this project, this application is 
capable of asking a question, collecting an answer, checking whether the answer is correct, add a point for the 
correct answer, giving a final score in number and percentage. I was able to apply the concepts of reading user 
input, organising data in structures like tuples, lists, and dictionary, if condition, for loop for repeated 
actions, Encapsulating the code for functions.</p>
